quorra.js
===============================

An interactive visualization library, focused on creating reusable visualizations on top of d3.js.


## Usage:

Add the d3.js and underscore.js assets into your project and include the quorra javascript and css assets in your HTML document via:

```html
<link href="quorra.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="quorra.min.js"></script>
```

Quorra assets can be found in the `dist/` folder within this repo, and the d3.js and underscore.js assets will be in the `lib/` folder created by running:

```bash
bower install
```

Or, if you don't want to use bower, you could alternatively find them [here (d3.js)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbostock/d3/master/d3.min.js) and [here (underscore.js)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jashkenas/underscore/master/underscore-min.js).
